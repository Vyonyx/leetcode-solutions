# Leetcode Solutions (by Shaneel Kumar)

This repository is a collection of personal leetcode solutions that I've used to pass their coding challenges.

The solutions are based on my current understanding of various data structures and algorithms. I hope to gain more knowledge on computer science fundimentals as I learn the required techniques to solve the various problem types.

These solutions also include SQL querys for common database manipulations (in the form of word problems).

## NeetCode Progress

I am using the Neetcode platform to work through collections of Leetcode questions that involve the use of similar concepts (ie. data structure or algorithm type). I am currently focused on solving "Stack" based problems.
